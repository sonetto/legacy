    /** @brief Game Module interface

        This class is used as an interface to abstract different modules
        for the Kernel, in such a way that a Map Module can be treated the
        same way as a Battle Module. Also, there can be additional modules
        created by you that, of course, are unknown at the point of compiling
        libSonetto. Such modules must inherit from Sonetto::Module and implement
        at least the pure virtual method Sonetto::Module::update(). The other
        methods have useful code that are common to any Module (like creating
        an Ogre::SceneManager and Ogre::Camera to them). If you happen to make a
        base call to any of these methods, make sure you do so to ALL of them, as
        each one expects each other's deeds in the class.
