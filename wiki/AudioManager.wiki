#summary How AudioManager works and how to use it.

= Introduction =
	Sonetto has an audio manager that is responsible for managing audio resources and abstracting the underlying audio libraries used to decompress and play audio data.

= Audio Concepts =
	This audio manager has three audio concepts: Audio Listeners, Musics and Sounds. Each of these concepts will be explained before we get into the "how to use" part of this wiki page.

== Audio Listeners ==
	An Audio Listener, for those not used to 3D audio, is a point in 3D space used to calculate each audio source's 2D channel panning. This panning is used by our brain to figure from where the sound is coming. They can be attached to events or to the current camera.

== Musics ==
	Musics are divided into two types: Background Musics and Music Effects.
	Background Musics are musics that loop indefinitely until you want them to stop. They have a loop point from which the music will start playing when the stream ends. This is used to make seamless looping possible without letting go of music introductions, which are needed to make it easier to loop and still make the music sound good. Background Musics can fade in and out when you ask them to start and stop playing.
	Music Effects, contrary to Background Musics, don't use the music loop point and never fade. They are played only once. If there is a background music playing when a Music Effect is asked to play, this background music will be faded out and faded back in from the point it stopped when the Music Effect ends.
	It is important to note that fading is always optional. If you supply a fading speed of zero to any method that uses fading, the proposed changes will be taken instantly, without fading.
	From here on, we will use the term BGM to refer to Background Musics and ME to Music Effects.
